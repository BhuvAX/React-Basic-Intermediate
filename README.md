## Learnings

### 1. JSX Basics

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used with React to describe what the UI should look like. It allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, which React then transforms into React elements.

### 2. Creating Components

Creating components in React is fundamental to building reusable and organized UIs. React components can be created using either function components or class components. Function components are more commonly used today, especially with the introduction of React Hooks.

### 3. Props

Props (short for "properties") in React are a core concept that allows you to pass data from one component to another. They are used to pass information from a parent component to a child component, making your components more dynamic and reusable.

### 4. Declarative vs. Imperative Programming

Declarative and imperative programming are two different programming paradigms that describe approaches to solving problems and writing code. In the context of React, these paradigms refer to different ways of defining and manipulating UI components.

### 5. Importing Non-JS Files

In React, you can import non-JavaScript files, such as images, stylesheets, JSON files, and other assets, using module bundlers like webpack or Parcel. These bundlers enable you to import these files directly into your JavaScript code and handle them as modules. Here's how you can import different types of non-JavaScript files in React:
